    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and
        for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services
        offered there.</p>
    <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred
        to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,
        organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by
        transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or
        destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
    <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration,
        and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We
        also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user
        experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III.
        Information about the data processing</p>
    <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
    <p>The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Benjamin Schober<br>Germany</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">E-Mail: admin@benjaminschober.de</span>
    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
            processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also
            Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
        <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
        <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
            processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to
            other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
        <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
            processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
        corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However,
        this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
        Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
    <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future
            processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
            processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage
        ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or
        unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

    <h4>Server data</h4>
    <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be
        collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version
        of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site
        visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
    <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
    <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
        stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
    <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
        purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
        relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
    <p>We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer
        by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location
        data, or IP address. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure, allowing us, for example, to display
        our website in different languages or to offer a shopping cart function.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR, insofar as these cookies are used to collect
        data to initiate or process contractual relationships.</p>
    <p>If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the
        functionality of our website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.</p>
    <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
    <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
    <p>If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we cooperate for the purpose of
        advertising, analyzing, or improving the features of our website.</p>
    <p>Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for the legal basis and purpose of such
        third-party collection and processing of data collected through cookies.</p>
    <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
    <p>You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to
        delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the
        browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your
        browser or contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash cookies from being
        set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this
        also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the help function or
        consult the documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.</p>
    <p>If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions on our site may be fully usable.

    <h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
    <p>We also integrate the following social media sites into our website. The integration takes place via a linked
        graphic of the respective site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the automatic
        connection to the servers of these networks for their display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic
        will you be forwarded to the service of the respective social network.</p>
    <p>Once you click, that network may record information about you and your visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out
        that such data will be processed in the United States.</p>
    <p>Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date and time of your visit, and the page
        visited. If you are logged into your user account on that network, however, the network operator might assign
        the information collected about your visit to our site to your personal account. If you interact by clicking
        Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored your personal user account and possibly posted on the
        respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out of your social media account before clicking on the
        graphic. The various social media networks also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.</p>

        Provider is GitHub, Inc, 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.</p>
    <p>When you visit a site equipped with a GitHub plugin, a connection is made to GitHub's servers. This tells the
        GitHub server which page you visited. GitHub also obtains your IP address. This applies even if you are not
        logged in to GitHub or do not have an account with GitHub. The information collected by GitHub is sent to
        GitHub's server in the USA.</p>
    <p>When you are logged in to your GitHub account, you allow GitHub to map your browsing behavior directly to your
        personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your GitHub account.</p>
    <p>For more information about how we handle user data, please see GitHub's privacy policy at <a

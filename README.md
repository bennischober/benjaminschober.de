Repository of my personal homepage. *The template of my homepage is designed to serve as a personal portfolio of my work, as well as a representation of my resume.*

My old homepage is built with [Bootstrap Material Design](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/), [the AOS Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) and some of my own styles. It also uses the scripts of Bootstrap Material Design (includes popper.js, jquery-3.5.1), the AOS Library and some of my own scripts.


This is the first version of my homepage, running for almost 1 year. Now it's time to re-design it and choose some new JavaScript libraries. I use [React](https://reactjs.org/) for this project.

Note: Use react-spring and Material-UI built in animations in future (if basic page is nearly done)

**Current tasks:**
| Priority | Task | Status |
| -------- | ---- | ------ |
| `high`   | add/change content | todo
| `medium` | update whole design and template | todo
| `medium` | update/change animations | todo
| `low`    | add dark/light mode | done
| `low`    | implement language settings | done
| `low`    | create 'CMS'-like software | todo


**Further updates (wishes):**

Language settings:
1. IP based language settings (via HTTP respond?)
2. User Agent languate settings (get User Agent language settings?)

CMS-like software:
* React Admin Page. Saves text data into database. NodeJS / NestJS job gets data from database and saves it into JSON file (=> fetch to file is faster than to DB)

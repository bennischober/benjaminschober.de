Repository of my personal homepage. *The template of my homepage is designed to serve as a personal portfolio of my work, as well as a representation of my resume.*

The style of my homepage is built with [Bootstrap Material Design](https://fezvrasta.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/), [the AOS Library](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos) and some of my own styles.

It also uses the scripts of Bootstrap Material Design (includes popper.js, jquery-3.5.1), the AOS Library and some of my own scripts.

This is the first version of my homepage, running for almost 1 year. Now it's time to re-design it!

Current tasks:
- [ ] Update Template
  - [ ] Update whole design (CSS, HTML structure, ... )
- [ ]  Update Content
- [ ]  Update scripts
- [ ]  Change folder structure
- [ ]  Implement IP tracked language setup
